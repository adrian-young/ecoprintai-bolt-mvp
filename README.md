# EcoPrint AI – MVP (One-Shot Prompt Build)

**EcoPrint AI** is an eco-conscious tool designed to estimate the carbon footprint generated by AI usage. Built as a one-shot prompt app using [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new), it allows users to calculate estimated CO₂ emissions based on the token usage of AI prompts.

---

## 🌱 Key Features

- Simple, lightweight UI (one-shot prompt build via Bolt.new)
- Manual token input with real-time carbon impact estimates
- Output expressed in **grams (gCO₂e)** for easy understanding
- Powered by open-source logic and community-centered design
- Eco-friendly mission: Helping people understand and reduce their digital footprint

---

## 🛠 Built With

- [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new)
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (exported from Bolt)
- Git + GitHub for version control

## 🚀 Hackathon Submission Updates

### ✅ One-Shot Prompt Challenge Submission

This project was submitted as part of the Bolt.new "One-Shot Prompt" challenge in the World's Largest Hackathon.

**Official One-Shot Prompt Used**:
> Create a simple, clean web app called "EcoPrint AI" that helps users estimate the carbon footprint of using AI models like GPT, Claude, or Gemini. The app should:
> - Allow users to select the AI model they’re using (GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini, etc.)
> - Let users input the number of tokens used (manually for now)
> - Display the estimated CO₂ emissions in grams or kgCO₂e based on their input
> - Use a minimalist, dark-themed UI with eco-friendly design elements (e.g., leaf icons, green accent colors)
> - Show a simple explainer or tooltip on how AI emissions are calculated
> - Include an input selector for region or electricity grid (optional for now)
> - Display results instantly after input using a friendly visual (like a gauge or progress bar)
> - Label the result section: “Your AI Carbon Footprint” and include a reset button.
> - Include a short footer with links for "About", "GitHub", and "Join the Movement".
